Neural Volumetric Rendering
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

All-in-one repository for state-of-the-art Luxens.

luxenactory provides a simple API that allows for a seamless and simplified end-to-end process of creating, training, and testing Luxens.
The library supports a more interpretable implementation of Luxens by modularizing each component.
With more modular Luxens, not only does your code become far more user-friendly, but using this framework also makes it easier for the community to build upon your implementation.
