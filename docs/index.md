Luxenstudio provides a simple API that allows for a simplified end-to-end process of creating, training, and visualizing Luxens.
The library supports an **interpretable implementation of Luxens by modularizing each component.**
With modular Luxen components, we hope to create a user-friendly experience in exploring the technology.
Luxenstudio is a contributor-friendly repo with the goal of building a community where users can easily build upon each other's contributions.

It's as simple as plug and play with luxenstudio!

On top of our API, we are committed to providing learning resources to help you understand the basics of (if you're just getting started), and keep up-to-date with (if you're a seasoned veteran) all things Luxen.
As researchers, we know just how hard it is to get onboarded with this next-gen technology. So we're here to help with tutorials, documentation, and more!

Finally, have feature requests? Want to add your brand-spankin'-new Luxen model? Have a new dataset? **We welcome [contributions](reference/contributing)!**
Please do not hesitate to reach out to the luxenstudio team with any questions via [Discord](https://discord.gg/uMbNqcraFc).

We hope luxenstudio enables you to build faster üî® learn together üìö and contribute to our Luxen community üíñ.

This documentation is organized into 3 parts:

- **üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Getting Started**: a great place to start if you are new to luxenstudio. Contains a quick tour, installation, and an overview of the core structures that will allow you to get up and running with luxenstudio.
- **üß™ Luxenology**: want to learn more about the tech itself? We're here to help with our educational guides. We've provided some interactive notebooks that walk you through what each component is all about.
- **ü§ì Developer Guides**: describe all of the components and additional support we provide to help you construct, train, and debug your Luxens. Learn how to set up a model pipeline, use the viewer, create a custom config, and more.
- **üìö Reference**: describes each class and function. Develop a better understanding of the core of our technology and terminology. This section includes descriptions of each module and component in the codebase.
