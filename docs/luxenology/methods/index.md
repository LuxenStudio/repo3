# Methods

We provide a set of pre implemented luxenstudio methods.

**The goal of luxenstudio is to modularize the various Luxen techniques as much as possible.**

As a result, many of the techniques from these pre-implemented methods can be mixed ðŸŽ¨.

## Running a method

It's easy!

```bash
ns-train {METHOD_NAME}
```

To list the available methods run:

```bash
ns-train --help
```
